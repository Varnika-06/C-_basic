# C-_basic

****Experiment No.: 1****

**Name**: Introduction to C++ and OOPS, Variables, Data Types, I/O Operations

**Tools Used**: VS Code

**Theory**: 
syntax: 

    #include<iostream>
    
    using namespace std; //must to import packages

    cout<<"Statement to be printed " //used to print the output
    
    cin>>variablename //used to take input

Implementation of simple arithmatic operations in C++

**Conclusion**: In this experiment, we explored the basics of C++ like printing an output and taking an input. Then we also explored how to do simple math problem in C++.
